    "## The basics\n",
    "Before we start with downward inference example in LNN we will describe the idea behind it. In simple case of one [*logical formula*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic#Formulas) with [*logical equality*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_equality) (also called Bidirectional implication, since it can be expressed as two logical implications and logical and) the downward inference is evaluation of the *operand* given the truth of the *operator* and rest of the operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logical equality is evaluated based on its *truth table* which can be seen below.\n",
    "![equality_tt](images/equality_tt.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we want to do downward inference on $P(x) \\Leftrightarrow Q(x)$ we have to provide truth value of the logical equality operator and one of the operands. Lets say that whole formula is evaluated to $False$ and truth value of predicate $P(x)$ is $True$. Situation is shown on image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![downward_inference](images/downward_inference.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can *infer* the truth value of predicate $Q(x)$ based on value of $P(x)$ and value of $P(x) \\Leftrightarrow Q(x)$. Since our operator is logical equality we can easily use truth table above and state that value of $Q(x)$ must be $False$.\n",

    "Now we are ready to move to our specific example and finally create a LNN model. We will continue with our grecian domain. We will extend it by new [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom). This axiom will be based on [ontology for word \"grecian\"](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&s=grecian&i=0&h=00#c). Let us modify description of our domain in natural language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All grecian is a native or resident of Greece.<br>\n",
    "* Grecians are mortal.<br>\n",
    "* Zeus is resident of Greece (is not native of Greece), is not mortal.<br>\n",
    "* Socrates is native of Greece (is not resident of Greece), is mortal.<br>\n",
    "* Confucius is neither native or resident of Greece, is mortal.<br>\n",
    "* Great Pyramid of Giza is neither native or resident of Greece, is not mortal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can formulate `All grecian is a native or resident of Greece` in context of First-order logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(\\forall x) (native\\_of\\_greece(x) \\lor resident\\_of\\_greece(x)) \\Leftrightarrow grecian(x)$\n",

    "**Axiom:**\n",
    "When we state that some formula is axiom we say that is taken to be true statemen in our domain. We can use this knowledge as a ground for infering future informations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Universal quantificator:**\n",
    "We used [*universal quantificator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification) $\\forall x$ to state that all objects from our domain have to satisfy our statement that `All grecian is a native or resident of Greece`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two new predicates:**\n",
    "We created two new predicates $native\\_of\\_greece(x)$ and $resident\\_of\\_greece(x)$. Since current one were not enought to express our domain from natural language description.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical disjunction:**\n",
    "We used new logical connective called [*logical didisjunction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) which represents \"or\" in natural language.\n",
